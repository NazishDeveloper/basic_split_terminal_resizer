# terminalresizer README


## Features

A very very very basic vscode ext

Auto resize terminal whenever you switch focus between split terminals

You can also resize manually by creating shortcuts for commands

    1. terminalResizer.resizeRight
    2. terminalResizer.resizeLeft

## Shortcomings

The extension works by geting terminals index no and checking if its even or not 
if its even then it resizes to right if odd then left hence,

    1. it can only work if you have two terminals in split layout
    2. you need to be careful in creating your terminals as it depends on index of terminal

## Suggestions

    1. use Terminals Manager ext to open terminals in same manner again and again.
    
**Enjoy!**
